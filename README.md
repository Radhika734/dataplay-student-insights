## Project Overview

The project leverages multiple data sources to track the applicant journey from application to internship completion. By analyzing the data, we aim to optimize recruitment strategies and enhance program performance.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Merged the company dataset with an open government dataset using the pincode as the key. This allowed enrichment of the original data with state, district, and region information for meaningful geographical analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized formats, removed duplicates, and handled missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new variables to support deeper analysis.
- **Dashboards**: Developed interactive dashboards for visual insights and data-driven decision-making.

## Data Wrangling

We applied a variety of data wrangling techniques to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis:

- Combined multiple data sources
- Standardized formats
- Removed duplicate entries
- Handled missing values
- Engineered new features

## KPIs Developed

To evaluate and improve internship program outcomes, the following key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed:

- Students Enrollment and Engagement Overview
- Student Profile and Internship Readiness Geo-distribution
- Geography, Experience, and Challenge Insights

## Key Insights

### Students Enrollment and Engagement Overview

- **Highest Total Applicants**: 'Friend Referred' source had the highest number of applicants at 44, which was 1,366.67% higher than 'Dataplay Reached Out To You' with only 3 applicants.
- **Correlation**: Total applicants and interns joined show a positive correlation.
- **Top Source**: 'Friend Referred' accounted for 57.89% of total applicants.
- **Degree Insights**: Among the top 10 degrees, total applicants ranged from 1 to 139, offers sent from 1 to 82, and students joined from 1 to 38.
- **Placement Status**: 199 students were not already placed, compared to 25 who were.

### Student Profile and Internship Readiness Geo-distribution

- **Orientation Test Scores**: Group 1 had the highest average score at 12.88, which was 114.58% higher than Group 3 with 6.00. Scores ranged from 6.00 to 12.88 across 16 attendance values.
- **Skills**: Python was known by 207 interns, followed by SQL and Excel.
- **Company Analysis**: Microsoft had the highest intern count at 11, followed by TCS and Google. Microsoft accounted for 9.48% of all company placements. Across 50 companies, counts ranged from 1 to 11.

### Geography, Experience, and Challenge Insights

- We've seen the highest student engagement in the DataPlay program coming from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.
- Many students are finding it difficult to build their skills in core areas of data science. The most common challenges include gaining hands-on experience, learning programming, working on real-world projects, and understanding machine 
  learning, statistics, and mathematics.
- Around 21% of students are finding it hard to demonstrate relevant experience when applying for jobs. Additionally, 10â€“15% are struggling to build projects to showcase in interviews and are also facing challenges in finding suitable job opportunities.

**This information helps the company improve its training programs, target high-engagement regions, and offer better career support to boost student success and program impact.**

## Dashboards

Interactive Power BI dashboards were created to visualize:

- Applicant sources and trends
- Intern skills and readiness
- Geographic engagement and placement distribution
- Overall program performance metrics

## Conclusion

The analysis and dashboards provided actionable insights into the applicant journey and internship program outcomes. These insights support improved recruitment efforts and program design.
