## Project Overview

The project leverages multiple data sources to track the applicant journey from application to internship completion. By analyzing the data, we aim to optimize recruitment strategies and enhance program performance.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Merged the company dataset with an open government dataset using the pincode as the key. This allowed enrichment of the original data with state, district, and region information for meaningful geographical analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized formats, removed duplicates, and handled missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new variables to support deeper analysis.
- **Dashboards**: Developed interactive dashboards for visual insights and data-driven decision-making.

## Data Wrangling

We applied a variety of data wrangling techniques to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis:

- Combined multiple data sources
- Standardized formats
- Removed duplicate entries
- Handled missing values
- Engineered new features

## KPIs Developed

To evaluate and improve internship program outcomes, the following key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed:

- Students Enrollment and Engagement Overview
- Student Profile and Internship Readiness 
- Geography, Experience, and Challenge Insights

## Key Insights

### Students Enrollment and Engagement Overview

- **Internship Progress (Previous Batch):**
In the previous batch, about 62% of students received internship offers, and roughly 25% successfully completed the internship, showing a solid conversion and completion rate.

- **Enrollment Growth:**
There has been a notable 20–25% increase in enrollments in the current batch compared to the previous one, indicating growing interest and trust in the program.

- **Learning Preferences:**
An overwhelming 80–90% of students prefer online and collaborative learning environments, suggesting the need for flexible and interactive formats.

- **Source of Engagement:**
Most student engagement comes through the DataPlay LinkedIn page, making it the most effective platform for outreach and visibility.

- **Internship Track Preferences:**
Around 30% of students prefer internship programs focused on SQL and Power BI, highlighting strong demand for data visualization and query language skills.


**This information helps the company scale effectively by understanding growth trends, student preferences, and the most impactful outreach channels.**



### Student Profile and Internship Readiness

- A majority of students—about 58%—are aiming to become Data Analysts, while around 33% are aspiring to become Data Scientists, showing a strong interest in analytics-focused career paths.
- **Academic Background:** Roughly half of the students come from B.Tech programs, primarily in Computer Science, IT, or Data Science streams, indicating a technically inclined learner base.

- **Skill Levels in Key Tools:** When it comes to tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI, around 40% of students are just getting started. Interestingly, about 60% haven’t even begun learning Statistics, highlighting a major gap in foundational skills.

**This information helps the company tailor its curriculum to match students’ career goals, technical backgrounds, and current skill levels for more effective learning outcomes.**

### Geography, Experience, and Challenge Insights

- We've seen the highest student engagement in the DataPlay program coming from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.
- Many students are finding it difficult to build their skills in core areas of data science. The most common challenges include gaining hands-on experience, learning programming, working on real-world projects, and understanding machine 
  learning, statistics, and mathematics.
- Around 21% of students are finding it hard to demonstrate relevant experience when applying for jobs. Additionally, 10–15% are struggling to build projects to showcase in interviews and are also facing challenges in finding suitable job opportunities.

**This information helps the company improve its training programs, target high-engagement regions, and offer better career support to boost student success and program impact.**

## Dashboards

Interactive Power BI dashboards were created to visualize:

- Applicant sources and trends
- Intern skills and readiness
- Geographic engagement and placement distribution
- Overall program performance metrics

## Conclusion

The analysis and dashboards provided actionable insights into the applicant journey and internship program outcomes. These insights support improved recruitment efforts and program design.
